 <h1>The Mumonkan</h1>

 <div>
     <h2>The Gateless Barrier</h2>
     <p>Buddhism makes mind its foundation. It makes No-gate its gate. If it is a No-gate, how can we pass
        through it? </p>
 </div>

 <div>
    <h2>Have you not heard:</h2>
    <p>"Things that come in through the gate are not treasures. What is gained
        as a result of cause and effect has a beginning and an
        end, and will be annihilated"</p>
 </div>

 <div>
    <p>The Great Way is gateless;<br>
        There are a thousand alleys.<br>
        If once you pass the barrier,<br>
        You walk alone through the universe</p>
